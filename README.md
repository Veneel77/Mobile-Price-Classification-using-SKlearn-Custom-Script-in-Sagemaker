Before starting, make sure you have the following set up:

AWS Account: You need an AWS account with administrative access.

AWS CLI: Configure the AWS CLI with your access key and secret access key.

Python Packages: Install the required packages from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Step-by-Step Guide
IAM User:
Create an IAM User with AdministratorAccess permissions in the AWS Management Console.

AWS CLI Configuration:
Configure the AWS CLI with your IAM User's access key and secret access key using the aws configure command.

Install Packages:
Install the necessary Python packages listed in requirements.txt.

Create S3 Bucket:
Create an AWS S3 bucket where you will store your dataset and model artifacts.

Load Data:
Load the Mobile Price Classification dataset.

Feature Engineering:
Perform any required feature engineering on the dataset.

Split and Save Data:
Split the dataset into training and testing data. Save these datasets as CSV files that can be uploaded to the S3 bucket.

Upload Data to S3:
Upload the CSV files to the S3 bucket.

Script.py:
Create a Python script, script.py, where you initialize the model and perform basic feature engineering.

SageMaker Execution:
SageMaker will access script.py for model training and testing.

Create IAM Role:
Create an AWS IAM role that SageMaker can use for accessing resources.

Create SageMaker Estimator:
Create an SKLearn Estimator for your model.

Train the Model:
Fit the estimator to the training and testing datasets stored in the S3 bucket.

Create a Model Copy:
Create a copy of the trained model that can be used for deployment.

Deploy an Endpoint:
Create a SageMaker endpoint that can be used to predict new instances. Note that endpoint creation is billable.

Testing:
Test your model on the testing dataset to evaluate its performance.

Delete the Endpoint:
After testing, remember to delete the SageMaker endpoint to avoid additional charges.
